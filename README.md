## project1 : Interpret a Data Visualization

### Project description


A large part of working with data is being able to interpret data visualizations and explain your insights to others. To give you some practice with this, we’ve selected a few Tableau dashboards for you to explore. The links are below, under "Choose from these Dashboards." Choose one of these dashboards, whichever one interests you the most, and find three insights in the visualizations. For each insight, provide a static image that shares what you found. Write a short report explaining each observation and how you found the information to reach your conclusion from the dashboard. Altogether (including images), your report should be 1-2 pages.




## project2 : Analyze NYSE Data

### Project description :

We used the Fundamentals.csv and Securities.csv files provided by Kaggle. The Fundamentals file provides the fundamental financial data gathered from SEC 10K annual filings from 448 companies listed on the S&P 500 index. The Securities file provided the industry or sector information the companies are categorized under on the S&P 500 index.


## project3 : Predicting Diamond Prices
### Project description

This project is designed for three main reasons:
To give you a feel for what you’ll be doing throughout the Nanodegree Program
To introduce you to Udacity’s project submission and review process
To make sure you feel comfortable with the basics before you begin. If it feels too easy, don't worry. We have some great stuff in store for you.


## project4  :Build Data Dashboards
### Project description

In this project, you'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. You will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
